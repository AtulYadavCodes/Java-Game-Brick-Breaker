# Java-Game-Brick-Breaker

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This brick breaker game is one of many fun Java projects that has you trying to break bricks at the top of the screen. The player controls a tiny ball placed on a small platform at the bottom of the screen, which can be moved around from left to right using the arrow keys. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform. The project makes use of Java swing and OOPS concepts, among other things.
